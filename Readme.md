### JAVASCRIPT FUNDAMENTAL - ASSIGNMENT QUESTIONS

# Q1. Write a JavaScript function called outerFunction that takes a parameter and returns an inner function. The inner function should access both the parameter of outerFunction and a variable declared within outerFunction. Demonstrate how lexical scoping allows the inner function to maintain access to these variables even after outerFunction has finished executing.

# Q2. Create a JavaScript program that demonstrates the basic usage of regular expressions. Write a function that takes a regex pattern and a string as input and returns true if there is a match, and false otherwise. Test the function with various patterns and strings.

# Q3. Write a JavaScript program that demonstrates the use of character classes in regular expressions. Create a function that searches for specific character classes in a given string and returns the matches. Test the function with patterns for digits, uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and special characters.

# Q4. Create a JavaScript program that takes a regex pattern and a string as input. Write a function that not only checks if there is a match but also extracts specific parts of the matched text using groups. Test the function with patterns that include groups to capture different parts of a date (e.g., day, month, and year) from a given string.

# Q5. You are building a shipping application. Write a program that takes the type of package ("standard", "express", or "overnight") and uses a switch statement to calculate and print the estimated delivery time based on the package type. For example, "standard" might take 3-5 days, "express" 1-2 days, and "overnight" would be delivered the next day.
